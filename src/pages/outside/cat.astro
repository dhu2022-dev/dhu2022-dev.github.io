  <h1>Cat Pictures</h1>

  <p>
    I have a cat who I adopted after fostering — her name is <strong>Sabrina</strong>,
    and she is the <strong>BEST</strong> cat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her personality is a mix of playful but elegant, with a hint of derpy
    (she’s got that orange-cat energy).
    What sticks with me most is that she can sense how I’m feeling and curls up
    next to me on a rainy day.
  </p>

  <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; margin:18px 0;">
    <img
      src="/readme_images/Sabrina.jpg"
      alt="Sabrina the Cat"
      height="200"
      width="200"
      loading="lazy"
      style="border-radius: 14px;"
    />
