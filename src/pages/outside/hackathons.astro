  <h1>🧑‍💻 Hackathons & Friends</h1>

  <p>
    I <strong>LOVE</strong> hackathons! Me and (sometimes the bois) chugging Red Bull to pump out a
    delusionally ambitious idea in less than 48 hours:

  <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; margin: 18px 0;">
    <img
      src="/readme_images/monkey_computer.gif"
      alt="funny gif"
      width="400"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </div>

  <p>
    Let’s connect! I enjoy meeting new people. I’m in a social fraternity while at college
    (proud <a href="https://phisigmakappa.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSK</a> Brother)
    and made some of my best friends by taking a risk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of my best projects were at other schools done with people I hadn’t met before.
    One good way to really know a person is to see how they perform in the middle of the night
    with only hours to spare.
    Learned expletives in many languages then lol.
