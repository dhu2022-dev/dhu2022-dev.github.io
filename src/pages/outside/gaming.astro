  <h1>🎮 Gaming</h1>

  <p>
    I enjoy games. My main ones: Minecraft (Hypixel Skyblock especially),
    League of Legends, and Clash of Clans.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fun fact: I moderate
    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tfblade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      TFBlade’s
    </a>
    channel, a League of Legends Twitch streamer with 1M+ followers (ask me how I ended up there!)
    and get paid in Riot Points (RP).
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t type and mainly do it during mealtime.
    My sister says this is a turn-off to girls,
    but on the bright side I have a lot of RP to give out since my time isn’t
    spent actually playing the game anymore.
