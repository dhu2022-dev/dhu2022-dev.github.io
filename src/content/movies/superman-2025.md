Considering how DC movies have been trending this was a nice improvement. Not particularly loyal to the comics or the superman lore but they made it work and connected the iconic elements of superman: perseverance through struggle, strong clash of strength leading to development, and a strong compassion for those around you. There were definitely strong political statements toward the Israel-Hamas conflict which was frankly annoying but if you don't think about that the movie is a good action movie. The actor did his best and the director stiched together a decent plot. Don't expect anything particularly deep but there were some moving scenes.
