Probably the best movie in the avengers franchise. Well orchestrated plot with healthy spread of characters that wasn't too overwhelming. Really felt like they were a team. Some cheesy fight scenes but I remember being hyped as a kid so that's all that matters. Some forced character development as well but the theme is kinda pure; it is geared as a kids movie and they did a good job of that.
