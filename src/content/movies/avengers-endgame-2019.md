I remember being really excited to watch this in theaters. It had the good build up and structure to a an awesome story but many of the plot threads were haphazardly tied down or left out hoping we'd forget. They were pretty ambitious doing such an epic collab which is pretty hard to do but imma be honest I didn't give a shit about some of the characters and some of them annoyed me and would be better left out of the movie. It felt like the movie should have been split into a couple shorter ones or a series to follow each character better. The ending was very emotional and sweet. However I felt like they made Thanos too overpowered for the plot and I got disengaged with it multiple times because of that; the struggle seemed too artificial.
