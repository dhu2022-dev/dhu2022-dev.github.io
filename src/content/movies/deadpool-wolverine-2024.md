Hilarious movie with well choreographed and planned action. They break the 4th wall a bit too many times though and there's always that dialogue with the watcher in classic Deadpool fashion. I personally didn't enjoy it too much but I have to admit it was funny and the movie moved forward enough with the action (one involved with time travel which was mediocrely done) fast enough to be ok. Top notch fight scenes, a story that made sense, and good jokes.
