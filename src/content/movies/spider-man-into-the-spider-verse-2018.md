This was a new take on the spider man universe. I quite enjoyed it actually, I thought it was going to be like the transformer cartoon adaptations where they make it hella goofy and chop most of the interesting plot points. This one had its own unique story and depth that would make it worth watching as an adult. I didn't like how it kept trying to spin some political narrative though like "oh look a hispanic kid can be smart and a superhero!" "look teens can be surprisingly mature too!". I didn't need an animated spider-man movie to tell me that bruh. Good, kind of heartwarming coming of age movie though.
