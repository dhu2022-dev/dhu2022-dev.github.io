Corny ah kids movie. It was a good kids movie but the plot was extremely predictable and some of the characters are irritating to watch because of how slow they change. Like the force themes and character development. It is a solid family movie though and the plot is well stitched together but I was not particularly excited watching it. I actually took a break in between to do something else cuz it was so aggressively vanilla.
