Humorous movie with good action scenes considering the era it was made. I really like Chris Tucker's energy in this film, duos well with Chan's Kung Fu. The plot is a simple plot that lines up, the characters don't have a lot of depth but then again it is an action comedy. A good, feel good movie, that has enough depth of emotions but don't expect some deep dialogue on society or super intense action scenes. Also plenty of racial elements but I ignored that given the context it was made in and they tied it down nicely so I was able to enjoy it.
