I quite enjoyed watching this movie. It's a slower paced one that does a good job conveying the heartwarming and unlikely friendship of two guys. I thought it was gonna be tacky and some racial dialogue but it was really well done and deep. Lots of character growth on both sides and a realistic story line that's engaging. Good movie to watch to chill or with the fam.
