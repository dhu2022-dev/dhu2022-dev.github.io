I watched this with a rare regathering of friends after I went to college. I was so scared that I covered my eyes for a good portion of the movie. This is a QUALITY horror movie if you're looking for a deep scare. The actors did an amazing job of masking emotion but also not being robotic for an eerie and otherworldly effect. Yet it seems so plausible they live in this world with the familiarity of people's actions and the environment. The characters all made smart, sensible decisions too that made you feel like you were helpless and truly in for a thrilling ride. Also there's a dialogue in their backstory and origination that makes a statement on society I found quite interesting, I won't spoil it but I highly recommend watching!
