This was a genuinely scary movie that I enjoyed watching. Do NOT watch this at night or you will not be able to sleep. What makes this extra scary is the reality of how a lot of society might be oblivious to many things and the most innocent of us all, the children, are able to see the threats the adults are almost purposefully ignorant of or trained to not be able to see. The man is actually slowly driven insane and the scary thing is I could see how it might happen to me. Expect vivid imagery and frequent twists in the simple!
