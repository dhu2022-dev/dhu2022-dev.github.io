As a kid this movie scared me shitless. I watched this before a robotics competition and it was so scary I couldn't sleep at night and I competed on like zero sleep. What's scary about this as a kid is that the struggle for parental connection navigating a new environment that Coraline faces is SO real and eerily relatable. The story is surprisingly complex and mind bending and the characters each have a depth to them that makes for a very emotional watch. Coraline also has some great growth transformed by fear and determination which I admire. As I grow older I realize her Dad tried his best; I used to resent him.
