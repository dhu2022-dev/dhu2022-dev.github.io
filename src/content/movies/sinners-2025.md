Great movie! I thought it was going to be some cheesy movie with racial dynamics and tropes behind a mediocre story but the plot was actually really deep and thrilling. Good movie describing human behavior under the supernatural/what we can't explain. Great dialogue between each of the characters and a satisfying ending that leaves you wanting more.
