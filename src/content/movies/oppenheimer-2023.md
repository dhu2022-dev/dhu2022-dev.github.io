I loved watching this movie! Really brought to life how cool physics and mathematics can be and the sharpness of impact it can bring into the real world, even if a bit dramatized. The story was actually done really well and adhered a good bit to historical fact. The movie did a really good job of stripping down what happened under the veil during such a tumultuous time in history. They didn't portray Oppenheimer as some autistic savant but as a relatable human being, albeit smart and hardworking, which I appreciated.
