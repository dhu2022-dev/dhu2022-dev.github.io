Timothee Chalamet did a really good job acting in this movie; it's also one he produced. I thought it was gonna be twink central and a flop but he got that dawg in him. You find out very quick why it's a R rated movie and the movie is extremely fast paced. He really does live life on the edge and the Movie does a good job of keeping you engaged in fast paced realistic thriller of a depraved individual chasing his dream to be a professional table tennis player in a depraved sense. It's borderline dystopian with the struggle of real life in those characters but it gives his life all the more meaning. Very exciting fast paced thriller to watch with the guys.
