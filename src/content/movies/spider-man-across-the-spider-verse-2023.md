Heartwarming movie continuing on the Spider Man universe of Miles Morales. Good themes of a kid coming of age beyond his years through conflict, navigating friendships with new strangers, and tackling a villain. Not your typical cheesy animated movie for kids, can be enjoyed by adults, but also not particularly dramatic or deep. Great movie to watch on a date or with the family.
