Pattinson did a good job with what he had but the plot was kind of just mid. Maybe it's because I was making unfair comparisons with Christian Bale's Batman directed by Christopher Nolan but I thought this plot was lackluster. This batman was portrayed as some depressed bozo who had random pockets of intellect seemingly out of character. It wasn't the cool, suave, tough batman that I was led to expect. Alone is fun but alone and depressed doesn't make for a superhero nor even realistic given his circumstances. I didn't feel like he made a difference at all, just some sad rich kid taking his rage out on some criminals and a slice of life bumping into some questionable characters. I kept waiting for something that never happened, it just fizzled out.
