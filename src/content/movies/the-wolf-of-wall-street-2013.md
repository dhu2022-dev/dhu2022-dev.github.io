This is a very raunchy movie. I watched it with my Dad and sister and let's just say it made for a very uncomfortable movie night. Expect sex scenes and a very depraved lifestyle for people living life a bit too fast. The characters in here are mostly shallow although the development of each character is interesting to watch and frankly a little scary on how any one of us can be transformed by the gravity of corporate greed and tycoon lifestyle. There are some very satisfying aura moments though. I used to admire these guys as a kid before I realized what I really wanted but it's a cool *fictional* glimpse into the crazy life of a man made rich in finance.
