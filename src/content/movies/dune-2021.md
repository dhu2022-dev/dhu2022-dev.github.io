I enjoyed reading the book more, I felt like the movie and its special effects didn't really do the plot and delicately depicted scenery justice. It felt more of some adventure in the sahara or obscure desert on earth; there wasn't really that otherwordly or adventurous feel. There were some key moments that were meant to be inspiring or awe inducing but Timothee Chalamet (overrated imo) just made it cringe and it killed the immersion. Did my best to enjoy it but I felt let down.
